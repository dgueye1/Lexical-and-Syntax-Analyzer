# Lexcal and Syntax Analyzer
 This is a Lexical and Syntax Analyzer that will parse some of the Java and C++ commands.
 
 -It processes the syntax for Java and C++
	-It is a C file. Look at the comment I put in the main function.
	-You can compile it using gcc -pthread -lm -o lexicalSyntax_Analyzer.c lexicalSyntax_Analyzer
	-You might need -std=c99 in the compilation process depending on your version of C
	-You can run it after the compilation process using ./lexicalSyntax_Analyzer
Enjoy!
